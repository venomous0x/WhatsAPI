####Note June 7th, 2013####
*venomous0x has been inactive for many months now and all the latest changes/fixes/updates are pushed to this repository instead. So I'll try to promote using this as the main repository for WhatsAPI instead as the original from venomous0x until they return.*

### What is WhatsApp?
According to [the company](http://www.whatsapp.com/): 

> “WhatsApp Messenger is a cross-platform mobile messenger that replaces SMS and works through the existing internet data plan of your device. WhatsApp is available for iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, Windows Phone, Nokia Symbian60 & S40 phones. Because WhatsApp Messenger uses the same internet data plan that you use for email and web browsing, there is no cost to message and stay in touch with your friends.”

Late 2011 numbers: 1 billion messages per day, ~20 million users.

### Modified XMPP
WhatsApp uses some sort of customized XMPP server, named internally as FunXMPP, which is basically some extended proprietary version.

### Login procedure
Much like XMPP, WhatsApp uses JID (jabber id) and password to successfully login to the service. The password is generated by the server and received upon registration.


The JID is a concatenation between your country’s code and mobile number.

Initial login uses Digest Access Authentication.

### Message sending
Messages are basically sent as TCP packets, following WhatsApp’s own format (unlike what’s defined in XMPP RFCs).

Messages are application level encrypted using RC4 keystreams

### Multimedia Message sending
Photos, Videos and Audio files shared with WhatsApp contacts are HTTP-uploaded to a server before being sent to the recipient(s) along with Base64 thumbnail of media file (if applicable) along with the generated HTTP link as the message body.

# FAQ


- **What’s with the hex chars floating all over the code?**

	Mostly WhatsApp’s proprietary control chars/commands, or formatted data according to their server’s specifications, stored in predefined dictionaries within the clients.

- **What’s your future development plans?**

	We don’t have any.

- **Would it run over the web?**

	We’ve tested a slightly-modified version on top of Tornado Web Server and worked like a charm, however, building a chat client is a bit tricky, do your research.

- **Can I receive chats?**

	Indeed, using the same socket-receiving mechanism. But you have to parse the incoming data. Parsing functions aren’t included in this release, maybe in the next one?

- **I think the code is messy.**

	It’s working.

- **How can I obtain my password?**

	Register a number using WhatsAPI or intercept your phone's password using MissVenom

# NOTES

- This proof of concept is extensible to contain every feature that make a fully-fledged client, similar to the official ones, actually could be even better.

- During the two weeks of analysis of service mechanisms, we stumbled upon serious design and security flaws (they fixed some of them since 2011). For a company with such massive user base, we expected better practises and engineering.
